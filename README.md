# CatanKotlinSparkService

To run the kotlin spark server, you need to run 'gradle build', then 'gradle run'. If it gets stuck around 83%, that means its working.

In order to test output on webpage, visit 'localhost:4567'. If it gives you a 404, that means it should work when the [react website](https://github.com/rickettsdev/CatanGameTypescriptPrototype) connects to it.
